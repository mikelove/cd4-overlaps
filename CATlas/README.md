# Overlap of CD4 cells from CATlas with T1D GWAS loci

Here, we download T1 lymphocyte 2 (CD4+) cells from the CATlas
resource:

In Figure 7 these cells are listed as overlapping in their cCRE with
Type 1 diabetes GWAS loci:

We then download Type I diabetes GWAS loci from GWAS Catalog:

The rest of the analysis is performed in the script `analysis.qmd`.
